## Overview

![screenshot](/deployedPage.png)

The project is a Web Development Challenge from <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>.
I have completed the challenge and successfully deployed the project on my github profile <a href="http://himanshu-196018.github.io" target="_blank">@Himanshu_196018</a>.
You can see the deployed site <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>

- This was my first challenge at Devchallenges.io and it was a brilliant experiance for me as I am starting my carrer as a Web Developer. I will try to solve more challenges provided by Devchallenges.io in the future. It is fun to see your own creation live in action.

- I have improved my basic skills for styling responsive web page by building this project. I have also learned responsive image styling which make page look more attractive. I came to know that it is easier to style phone design first then design for bigger window or screen. 

- I want to tell all my fellow developers that keep practicing, keep upgrading your skills and take some challenge to improve your basics too. If your basics are strong then there will be less hurdle in your way for becoming a web developer.
